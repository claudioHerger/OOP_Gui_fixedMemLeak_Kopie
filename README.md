# TA_analysis_GUI

A GUI for the analysis of time-resolved spectroscopic data.
Lets the user inspect the original data and its SV decomposition. A set of SVD components can be selected to reconstruct the original data via a global fit.
There is also an experimental feature that allows the user to define a target model to be used in the fit.
